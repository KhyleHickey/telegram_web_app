Event Telegram Mini-App Demo
============================

Mini Apps is a Python framework to create [Telegram Mini Apps](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps).

There are some built-in apps that showcase the features of both this framework and the mini apps feature on Telegram:

_Mini Events_ is a demo app, it shows a list of events the user can attend and uses websockets to dynamically
update information to the client.

_Tic Tac Toe_ allows you to play tic tac toe (also known as naughts and crosses) against another player on Telegram.

_Glaximini_ is a more complex app that allows the user to create animated stickers and share them on Telegram.

Full documentation is available on [Read the Docs](https://mini-apps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
